This command line challenge is designed to help you become familiar with the bash/command line. The challenge goes over the most used commands every developer needs to know in order to succeed in real life.

> :exclamation: We strongly recommend reading [The Command Line lesson](https://4geeks.com/lesson/the-command-line-the-terminal) on the 4Geeks.com platform.

ðŸ’» The challenge is built for computers using the Linux bash. Use [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) if you need a terminal in the cloud.
